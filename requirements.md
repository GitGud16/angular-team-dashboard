# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This application is a complete lightweight, modular Angular front-end team dashboard built as part of a technical challenge. The standalone application will display team member data dynamically with filtering capabilities, state management using RxJS, and comprehensive testing. The solution must demonstrate clean architecture and modern Angular best practices within a 3-4 hour development timeframe.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to view all team members in a responsive dashboard, so that I can quickly assess team composition and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display all team members in a responsive list or grid layout
2. WHEN displaying team members THEN the system SHALL show Name, Role, Status, and Performance Indicator for each member
3. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively across different screen sizes
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch team data from a mock API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to filter team members by role or status, so that I can focus on specific subsets of the team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a role filter THEN the system SHALL display only team members with that role
2. WHEN I select a status filter THEN the system SHALL display only team members with that status
3. WHEN I clear filters THEN the system SHALL display all team members again
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time without page refresh (reactively)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use modern Angular architecture patterns, so that the code is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL use feature modules with lazy loading
2. WHEN routing is configured THEN the system SHALL implement lazy-loaded routing
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use RxJS for API streams, loading states, and filtering
4. WHEN structuring components THEN the system SHALL follow component-based architecture principles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing unit tests THEN the system SHALL include 1-2 unit tests using Jasmine/Karma
2. WHEN implementing integration tests THEN the system SHALL include 1 basic end-to-end test using Cypress or Playwright
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL pass all test cases successfully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be accessible, so that I can use it effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing HTML structure THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML elements
2. WHEN adding interactive elements THEN the system SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels
3. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation
4. WHEN accessibility features are implemented THEN the system SHALL document WCAG considerations in README

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the code, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand the implementation and setup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions in README.md
2. WHEN explaining the solution THEN the system SHALL provide an architecture overview
3. WHEN documenting decisions THEN the system SHALL list any assumptions made
4. WHEN reflecting on development THEN the system SHALL include a short reflection on the most challenging part
5. WHEN AI tools are used THEN the system SHALL explain which tools were used, for what purpose, and what was adjusted or rejected

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the application to simulate real API behavior, so that it demonstrates proper data handling patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API integration THEN the system SHALL use Angular HttpClient
2. WHEN simulating API behavior THEN the system SHALL use a mock API service
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading states
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
